    "# Half Ironman 70.3 Performance Analysis Using Quantile Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook implements quantile regression to analyze how different factors affect Half Ironman (70.3) triathlon performance across various performance percentiles. Unlike traditional OLS regression that focuses on conditional means, quantile regression allows us to understand how relationships between variables may differ across the entire distribution of finishing times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "1. How do sub-event times (swim, bike, run) influence overall performance differently across different performance quantiles in Half Ironman events?\n",
    "2. How do environmental factors (temperature, elevation, wind, humidity, etc.) affect Half Ironman athletes differently depending on their performance level?\n",
    "3. Do certain factors have stronger effects on elite athletes (lower quantiles) versus recreational athletes (higher quantiles) in Half Ironman races?\n",
    "4. How do performance patterns differ between male and female Half Ironman athletes across the performance spectrum?\n",
    "5. How do these patterns compare to the Full Ironman findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "We apply quantile regression with a statistical significance threshold of p < 0.05 to identify reliable effects across different performance levels. All time variables are measured in seconds for precise analysis."

    "### Sub-event Time Effects (Model 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Swim Time**: \n",
    "   - The coefficient for swim time remains relatively consistent across all quantiles, ranging from approximately 1.0-1.05.\n",
    "   - This suggests that the contribution of swim time to overall Half Ironman performance is fairly uniform across performance levels.\n",
    "   - The swim leg represents a proportionally larger part of total race time in Half Ironman compared to Full Ironman events.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bike Time**:\n",
    "   - The bike time coefficient shows a gradual upward trend across quantiles, ranging from about 1.02 at the 0.1 quantile to 1.06 at the 0.9 quantile.\n",
    "   - This indicates that bike performance has a slightly stronger effect on overall time for slower athletes.\n",
    "   - Given the relatively shorter bike leg in Half Ironman (56 miles vs 112 miles in Full), the coefficient pattern suggests a more balanced contribution across disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run Time**:\n",
    "   - The run time coefficient shows the most notable increase across quantiles, from about 1.05 at the 0.1 quantile to 1.15 at the 0.9 quantile.\n",
    "   - This significant upward trend indicates that running performance becomes increasingly important for recreational athletes in Half Ironman events.\n",
    "   - The half marathon distance (vs. marathon in Full Ironman) appears to still generate substantial performance differences between athlete levels."

    "### Environmental Factor Effects (Model 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Elevation**: \n",
    "   - The effect of elevation shows a U-shaped pattern across quantiles, with stronger positive effects for both elite athletes (0.1 quantile) and recreational athletes (0.9 quantile).\n",
    "   - This suggests that both the fastest and slowest athletes are more affected by elevation changes in Half Ironman events.\n",
    "   - Mid-pack athletes (0.5 quantile) show a smaller but still significant positive relationship between elevation and race time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temperature**:\n",
    "   - Temperature effects exhibit a stronger positive relationship with race time for elite athletes (lower quantiles) than for recreational athletes (higher quantiles).\n",
    "   - This is notable because it indicates that faster athletes may be more sensitive to temperature changes, perhaps due to their higher intensity efforts.\n",
    "   - The shorter Half Ironman duration (compared to Full) may concentrate temperature effects on high-intensity performers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Water Temperature**:\n",
    "   - Water temperature shows varied effects across quantiles with a general trend toward a negative relationship with race time for the fastest athletes.\n",
    "   - This suggests that optimal water conditions may particularly benefit elite Half Ironman swimmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature)**:\n",
    "   - WBGT impact is most pronounced in the middle quantiles (0.25-0.75), with positive coefficients indicating that higher WBGT values lead to slower times.\n",
    "   - The Half Ironman distance appears to make athletes particularly susceptible to this composite heat stress measure during the middle portions of the performance spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Wind Speed**:\n",
    "   - Wind speed shows a strong positive effect on race times, particularly for mid-to-back-of-pack athletes (0.5-0.9 quantiles).\n",
    "   - This suggests that recreational athletes struggle more with windy conditions in Half Ironman events, likely due to reduced aerodynamic efficiency.\n",
    "   - The proportionally greater importance of the bike leg in Half Ironman may amplify wind effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Humidity**:\n",
    "   - Humidity effects appear strongest at the upper quantiles (0.75-0.9), indicating that slower athletes are more significantly affected by humid conditions.\n",
    "   - This may reflect their longer exposure time and potentially less efficient thermoregulation during Half Ironman events."

    "### Combined Effects (Model 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "When sub-event times and environmental factors are analyzed together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The time variables (swim, bike, run) maintain similar patterns to Model 1, confirming their robust relationship with overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Environmental factors show reduced coefficients compared to Model 2, indicating that some of their effects operate through their influence on individual discipline performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Wind and temperature retain statistical significance even after controlling for sub-event times, highlighting their direct impact on Half Ironman performance beyond just slowing down individual legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender Differences (Model 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Gender Effect**:\n",
    "   - Male athletes are consistently faster than female athletes across all quantiles, with the gap ranging from approximately 600-900 seconds (10-15 minutes).\n",
    "   - The gender gap appears narrower in lower quantiles (elite athletes) and wider in higher quantiles (recreational athletes).\n",
    "   - The gender performance difference is slightly smaller in Half Ironman compared to Full Ironman events.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gender in Full Model**:\n",
    "   - Gender remains a significant predictor even after controlling for sub-event times and environmental factors.\n",
    "   - The gender effect size is reduced in the full model, suggesting that some gender differences are expressed through how the disciplines and environmental factors affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gender-Discipline Interactions**:\n",
    "   - The interaction between gender and swim time is strongest at the middle quantiles (0.25-0.75), indicating different patterns in how swim affects overall time for male vs. female athletes.\n",
    "   - Bike-gender interactions show significant effects primarily in the upper quantiles (0.5-0.9), suggesting that recreational male and female athletes differ more in how bike performance contributes to overall time.\n",
    "   - Run-gender interactions are significant across all quantiles but strongest at the extremes (0.1 and 0.9), indicating that gender differences in running contribution exist throughout the performance spectrum in Half Ironman events."

    "1. **Swim Comparison**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman**: Swim coefficients show minimal variation across quantiles but are generally lower (0.95-1.02), indicating a relatively smaller contribution to overall time.\n",
    "   - **Half Ironman**: Swim coefficients are more consistent across quantiles and slightly higher (1.0-1.05), reflecting the proportionally larger contribution of the swim leg to the overall race.\n",
    "   - **Key Difference**: The swim leg has greater proportional importance in Half Ironman events, but shows less variation in its effect across performance levels compared to Full Ironman.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bike Comparison**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman**: Bike coefficients show a moderate upward trend from fastest to slowest athletes (1.01 to 1.08) and generally have larger absolute values, reflecting the substantial contribution of the 112-mile bike leg.\n",
    "   - **Half Ironman**: Bike coefficients show a similar but slightly less pronounced upward trend (1.02 to 1.06), indicating a more balanced effect across performance levels.\n",
    "   - **Key Difference**: While the bike leg is critical in both formats, it shows a more dramatic increase in importance for slower athletes in Full Ironman, likely due to the compounding effects of fatigue over the longer distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run Comparison**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman**: Run coefficients display a steep increase across quantiles (1.03 to 1.20), showing substantially greater importance for slower athletes.\n",
    "   - **Half Ironman**: Run coefficients also increase across quantiles (1.05 to 1.15) but with a less extreme slope.\n",
    "   - **Key Difference**: The run leg becomes disproportionately important for recreational athletes in both formats, but this effect is more extreme in Full Ironman, where the marathon distance can create larger time gaps between athletes due to fatigue and pacing issues."

    "\n",
    "3. **Full Model Gender Effect Comparison**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman**: Controlling for other factors reduces but does not eliminate the gender gap, with substantial residual difference remaining.\n",

    "### Practical Implications of Differences Between Race Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Focus**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman Athletes**: Should prioritize run resilience and efficiency, particularly for recreational athletes, as this discipline shows the most dramatic increase in importance across quantiles. Elite athletes should balance their focus across disciplines with particular attention to maintaining swim and bike performance.\n",
    "   - **Half Ironman Athletes**: Should adopt a more balanced training approach across disciplines, with slightly greater emphasis on the bike, which shows a more consistent contribution to overall performance. Elite Half Ironman athletes should pay special attention to swim performance given its proportionally larger contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Environmental Preparation**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman Athletes**: Should emphasize heat acclimation and nutrition strategies for extended exposure to environmental conditions. Recreational athletes should prioritize temperature and humidity adaptation.\n",
    "   - **Half Ironman Athletes**: Should focus on wind resistance training and aerodynamic efficiency, as wind effects appear particularly impactful in this format. Elite Half Ironman athletes should prepare for temperature effects, while recreational athletes should focus more on wind and humidity adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Race Strategy**:\n",
    "   - **Full Ironman**: Pacing is critical, with run pacing being most decisive for recreational athletes. Conservative bike efforts to preserve run performance are generally advised, especially for mid-to-back-of-pack athletes.\n",
    "   - **Half Ironman**: More aggressive bike strategies can be effective for appropriately trained athletes, as the bike leg has a more balanced impact across performance levels. Run pacing is still important but less dramatically deterministic than in Full Ironman events.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gender-Specific Approaches**:\n",
    "   - **Female Full Ironman Athletes**: Should focus particularly on run economy and resilience, as gender-run interactions show the largest differences. More conservative bike pacing may benefit female athletes more than males.\n",
    "   - **Female Half Ironman Athletes**: May benefit from focused bike training, as gender-bike interactions show significant differences particularly in the upper quantiles. The more balanced distribution of gender-discipline interactions suggests a more evenly distributed training approach can be effective."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our quantile regression analysis reveals important differences in how various factors affect performance across Full and Half Ironman events. These differences highlight that the two race formats are distinct challenges requiring tailored approaches rather than simply scaled versions of the same event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different Performance Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - Half Ironman events show more balanced effects of the three disciplines across performance levels, while Full Ironman events display more dramatic increases in the importance of running for recreational athletes.\n",
    "   - Environmental factors affect the two race formats differently, with extended exposure in Full Ironman amplifying temperature and humidity effects, while the proportionally greater importance of the bike leg in Half Ironman amplifies wind effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gender Differences**:\n",
    "   - The gender performance gap is smaller in absolute terms in Half Ironman events.\n",
    "   - Gender-discipline interaction patterns differ between formats, suggesting unique physiological and strategic considerations for male and female athletes in each format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance-Level Effects**:\n",
    "   - The effect of factors varies by performance level (quantile) in both formats but with different patterns.\n",
    "   - Elite athletes (lower quantiles) in both formats show distinct responses to environmental conditions compared to recreational athletes (higher quantiles).\n",
    "   - The gap between elite and recreational athletes appears more pronounced in Full Ironman events, likely due to the compounding effects of fatigue over the longer distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training and Racing Implications**:\n",
    "   - Athletes should adopt format-specific training approaches that account for the different patterns of variable effects across quantiles.\n",
    "   - Race strategy should be tailored not only to the athlete's gender and performance level but also to the specific race format.\n",
    "   - Environmental adaptation strategies should differ between formats, with greater emphasis on heat/humidity endurance for Full Ironman and greater focus on wind resistance for Half Ironman.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of quantile regression with statistical significance testing (p < 0.05) has allowed us to identify reliable differences in how various factors affect performance across the spectrum of athlete abilities in both triathlon formats. These insights extend beyond what traditional regression approaches would reveal and provide valuable information for athletes, coaches, and race organizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these format-specific patterns can help athletes make more informed decisions about race selection, training focus, and race-day execution, ultimately leading to better performances and more enjoyable race experiences regardless of ability level."
